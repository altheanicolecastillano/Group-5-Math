 In christianity dove symbolize as the Holy Spirit. In Matthew 3:16 and Luke 3:22 dove is compared to the Holy Spirit at Baptism of Jesus. Dove also symbolize hope to people because in Noah's ark dove is released and later on returns with a branch of olive to let people inside the ark know that the flood is over. So we see this as hope because it gives hope to the people in Noah's ark so if it gives hope to them so same as the people here in present time. </font> </p>
